Laundroid

you, a small robot programmmed to do laundry, wake up in am empty house.

There are socks all over the place. You feel driven to pick them up and put them in the dirty basket.
after picking up all the socks, a lizard pokes his head out from behind something.
He rushes out and you try to grab him, but he evades you, grabbing onto you.

He begins pulling your head off.
the screen starts glitching.

The simulation ends. You are a lizard, face to face with a lizard wearing a sock.

He tells you you've been collecting lizards and stuffing them in the basket. 
You were a lizard who thought he was a robot trying to grab a lizard that was actually a sock, 
but you were actually a lizard grabbing a sock that was being worn by a lizard, 
before you realised you'd been grabbing socks that were actually lizards.

Someone has used you.
