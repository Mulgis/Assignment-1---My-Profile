    <h2>What is your interest in IT?</h2>

    <p>I’ve always had some affinity with computers and other devices, and I want to develop that further.
When it comes to technology there are so many possibilities, there’s just about nothing we cannot do. It’s the great connector of all things, allowing us to utilize/nurture/develop. a magnificent, albeit double edged sword with which we interface with the natural world and with others.
So yeah, tech is cool, and I want to explore its endless potential.
</p>

<h2>When did your interest in IT start?</h2>
<p>When I was 6 years old, my dad brought home a brand-new PlayStation and it was the most amazing thing I’d ever seen. Understandably, I was instantly hooked on video games, and I guess it’s obvious that’s where my interest began. I remember wanting to build robots for some reason and would constantly pester the old man about it, as he was always working in the shed, and I just assumed he could build anything.</p>

<h2>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h2>
<p>We got a desktop PC when I was 8, which wasn’t getting any signal to the monitor.
Dad spent an entire day flicking through the manual, trying to figure out why it wasn’t working – until I walked in and pressed the button on front of the tower. I remember feeling pretty savvy in that moment. Growing up, I mostly just used IT for entertainment but also found some satisfaction in finding a fix whenever things went wrong.
I have no real experience, I’ve offered troubleshooting for a lot of people, mainly older folk with computer troubles, but I’ve never been officially employed in the industry.
</p>

<h2>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
<p>Ultimately, I chose to come to RMIT because it was recommended by a consultant. I’d never done Uni before, but knew I wanted to do something in IT and IIT will help me get an idea of Uni life while working towards a degree.</p>

<h2>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>
<p>There’s a lot... things I don’t really comprehend, such as machine learning, cyber security, or the Internet of Things. Or things I’ve dabbled in but need a refresher on, like using HTML/CSS.</p>
