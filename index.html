      <h2>Background Info</h2>
      <p>I am an Australian of English, Scottish, Swedish, French and German descent. I’ve learned various languages in the past but not enough to label anything as a second language.</p>
      <p>Music is one of my favourite pastimes; I play guitar, I have a somewhat eclectic taste but mainly I like various subgenres of metal. I’m a heavy gamer and I love roguelikes, grand strategy, RPGs (especially Dark Souls/Elden Ring) and pretty much anything to do with space, such as Stellaris, No Man’s Sky, and Freelance and the X universe back in the day.</p>
      <p>I have a pet gecko named Geg who found his way inside on Easter Sunday when he was very young, so we rescued him. They’re not super common where I live and I always loved lizards, particularly geckos, so I was pleasantly surprised to find him on my bedroom wall. Little fella’s nearly fully grown now.</p>

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>I have a Cert II in IT, Cert II in Civil Construction and a Cert III in Microbusiness Operations.</p>
