      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Unity Game that begins under the false title of “Laundroid” but eventually reveals the real title to be “Lizard Kingdoms”.
I love reptiles and strategy games and after struggling to come up with something interesting, in hindsight I think combining the two could be a great project.</p>
<p> A light-hearted, humourous game about a lizard who has been manipulated into capturing many of his own people by an unseen figure or group, for reasons unknown to him, and his quest for redemption and truth.
Embark on a journey of discovery or conquest, or both depending on the direction taken with this project.</p>
<p> A light-hearted combat role-playing game or real time strategy game would certainly be interesting, especially if completely centered around reptiles as I have never seen anything like this before.
</p>
<br>

      <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>Truth be told, I ran out of time and left the most important section until last, because of nerves etc.
I had come up with some other ideas, but they were all silly.</p>

<p>That said, I wanted to do something fun. It may not help me work towards my ‘ideal job’, but making games is something I always wanted to do in some capacity, and some experience here would give me new ways to contribute to projects I’m already involved in.</p>

<p>I want to build something fun and interesting, and I like the idea of blending unlikely genres of things to produce something new. However, I’m sure that won’t be achievable at this stage, and it will be challenging enough as is.
</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>You are a small robot programmed to do laundry; you wake up in an empty house.
There are socks all over the place. You feel driven to pick them up and put them in the dirty basket.</p>

<p>after picking up all the socks, a lizard pokes his head out from behind something.
He rushes out and you try to grab him, but he evades you, grabbing onto you.
He begins pulling your head off.
the screen starts glitching, as he manages to remove the device controlling you.
The illusion ends.</p>
<p> You are a lizard, face to face with a lizard wearing a sock.
He informs you that you've been collecting lizards and stuffing them in baskets.</p>
<p>A lizard who thought he was a robot trying to grab a lizard that was actually a sock, but it turns out you were a lizard grabbing a sock that was being worn by a lizard,
until you realized you'd been grabbing socks that were actually lizards.</p>

<p><strong>Someone has used you.</strong></p>

<h3><em>The real game begins?</em></h3>

<p>At this point, the game may transform into a story game with combat mechanics, real time strategy, or more of an investigative nature. Possibly being adapted later to require players to utilize basic hacking principles to advance.</p>

<p>If I go with strategy, it will involve base-building and recruitment of different unit types,
different units being different subspecies of each reptile race.</p>

<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Marbled geckos could be wizards (Hehe)</li>
<li>Yellowbellies could be the main workhorse</li>
<li>Leaf-tails could be spies/assassins/rogue-types</li>
<li>Crested geckos could be the main warrior class</li>
<li>Golden geckos could rise up as rulers</li>
<li>There could be bearded dragons that are giants on the battlefield, maybe showing no loyalty to any faction</li>
</ul>

<br>
<p>Perhaps there is conflict between geckos and skinks, meaning there are now factions to differentiate:</p>
<br>

<ul>

<li>Major skinks could be the warrior class</li>
<li>Northern coal skinks could be wizards</li>
<li>Glossy grass skinks could be spies/assassins/rogue-types</li>
<li>Emerald tree skinks could be the rulers</li>
<li>Five-lined skinks could be the workhorse</li>
</ul>

<p>There could be more factions, which I would very much like to explore eventually, though these two would likely be enough for the time being.</p>

<p>There could be a blend of magic and technology, or perhaps an inextricable union of the two.
Maybe even a third, mysterious force which is left unexplained, or hinted at throughout the story. Perhaps it is widely known, yet not understood, or it is a hidden force unknown to the denizens of this macro world. I don’t think I’ll include any deities, though spirituality could certainly play a role in things.</p>

<p>Spells could require the use of strange arcane gadgets, perhaps some of these could even be devices that are very clearly alien in design, having been looted from a tiny UFO crash site. Perhaps the lizards could show no sign of a concept of extraterrestrial life and simply loot these craft without a second thought.</p>

<p>On the subject of base building, they could live in things like empty cans and discarded trash or have a quirky architecture unique to their faction.
Each faction could have distinctly different societies, some being more savage or brutal in nature than others, some being more spiritual or exploratory etc.
</p>

        <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
        <p>Will be made using Unity predominantly, and obviously collaboration through GitHub.
I’ve chosen Unity over unreal or Godot, due to the lack of tutorial material for Godot as well as my previous experience with unity, working on 2D games.</p>

<p>If producing assets from scratch (likely necessary), may need to make use of programs like maya or blender, although this can also be done in unity with less functionality at potentially lower quality.
Depending on direction of development, may need knowledge of basic hacking principles down the line although this is unlikely.
Will probably need software for producing music and sound effects.
</p>

        <h2>Skill Required</h2>
        <p>May require some programming knowledge, but most likely possible using only unity and GitHub. May need skills involving external programs such as Maya or Blender.</p>

<p>Producing music for video games has been something of a side project already for me this year, which would obviously prove very useful for something like this, even if much further down the line.
</p>

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>At the very least, I’ll gain some experience using GitHub, and of course some experience with Unity could help with visualizing concepts in the future, as well as some side projects I’ve been involved with in recent years in a small capacity.
